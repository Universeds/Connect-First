# 🚀 Connect First - Hackathon Pitch Deck
## YC-Level Startup Pitch Summary

---

## 🎯 THE PROBLEM (Hook - 30 seconds)

**Non-profits are drowning in inefficiency.**

Every day, community organizations struggle with:
- **Manual tracking** of urgent needs via spreadsheets and emails
- **No visibility** into what's been funded vs. what's still needed
- **Critical items getting buried** - medical supplies lost in a sea of requests
- **Donors can't see impact** - no real-time progress tracking
- **Seasonal urgency ignored** - winter coats requested in December, delivered in March

**The result?** People in need wait longer, donors lose trust, and organizations burn out managing chaos.

---

## 💡 THE SOLUTION (Vision - 1 minute)

**Connect First** is the **Stripe for non-profit needs management** - a real-time, transparent platform that connects donors directly with urgent community needs.

### Core Value Proposition:
- **For Non-Profits**: Automated inventory management with priority-based routing
- **For Donors**: Real-time progress bars showing exactly where their money goes
- **For Communities**: Critical needs (medical, food, shelter) funded first, not last

### Key Innovation:
We don't just track donations - we **prioritize by urgency** and **visualize impact in real-time**. Every need has a progress bar showing: "We've raised $2,400 of $5,000 for winter coats."
